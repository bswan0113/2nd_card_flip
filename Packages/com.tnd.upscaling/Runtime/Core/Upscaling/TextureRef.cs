    /// While the modern render pipelines mostly use Texture and derived types, some older legacy systems still use indirect RenderTargetIdentifiers instead.
    /// The problem with RenderTargetIdentifier is that Unity provides no easy way to convert that to a Texture object or obtain a native texture pointer.
    /// Since most native plugin-based upscalers require native texture pointers, this presents a problem that is usually solved by blitting or copying to a temporary render texture.
    /// We do not want to burden the upscaler plugins with this complexity, hence the reason for this struct's existence.
    ///
    /// Upscaler plugins will see TextureRef as part of their input and can simply request the type of texture reference that they require using a stable API.
    /// Meanwhile, the framework and render pipeline integrations will deal with managing temporary render textures and blitting where necessary.
    /// This also allows the framework to make improvements to efficiency in the future as and when possible, without breaking the public upscaler plugin API.
